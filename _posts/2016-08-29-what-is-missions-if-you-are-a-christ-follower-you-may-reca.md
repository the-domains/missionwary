  What is missions? If you are a Christ-follower, you may recall Jesus’ parting
  words to his disciples prior to his ascension, “Go and make disciples of all
  nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
  teaching them to obey all I have commanded you.” So, missions, simply put,
  means going to other nations to convert people, right? Hold on there. Not so
  fast. First, where are my manners? Allow me to introduce myself.

My wife, four kids and I are missionaries. We are part of a mission agency born in the 19th century by one of the fathers of the modern missionary movement. We daydream about people movements, i.e. ethnic groups coming to believe in Jesus en masse. We wade through cultures and languages not our own every day. Our 5 and 7 year old children could navigate international airports better than most adults. We eat gospel-contextualization for breakfast. I believe in Jesus---no, I know and love Jesus---and I'm unashamed to say that everyone should get to know him, too. So, why the "wary" in the title? Good question.

I love that the definitions of "mission" and "wary" are both strong, positive feelings that seem to contradict one another. One is a driving boldness toward action for the common good. The other is a cautious trepidation so that mistakes don't get made. Can we really have it both ways? Is this not the proverbial "eating the cake and having it, too?" Can one be a charging lion and a careful deer at the same time? If you or any one you know is considering long-term cross-cultural missions as a career, the answer is and must be yes. 

Even a cursory glance at missions history will show you the many pitfalls, blunders, offenses and even outright injustices perpetrated by the "industry." In many cases it feels like it would have been better for the recipients had the missionaries never made it to them. Jesus' words are a frightful warning to anyone considering going to another country to evangelize: _"...you travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then you make that convert twice as much a child of hell as you are" (Mt. 23:15)._ And then there are the hundreds of thousands of well-meaning groups every year that donate energy, people and money for short-term missions trips that create dependency, paternalism, shame and disempowerment. That's why I use the word "wary." ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f7c2b439-7508-4edf-85e4-b29cce364341.jpg)

Of course, there are many testimonies of those who have done "missions" right, where honor and dignity were maintained, where genuine love was communicated and received, and where people made a commitment to follow this Jesus. In light of the many failures and the many successes, this question, "how ought we do missions now?" is what I want to explore with this blog. 

In weeks to come, we will also wrestle with other questions like, 

* What are the essential elements of a "church meeting?" 
* What is the church? 
* What are the essential elements of belief?
* Can one be a missionary and involved in "real work?" 
* What are the differences between building the "Kingdom of God" versus building Christianity? 
* What is the 5-fold and why is it necessary in missionary endeavors? 
* and many other thought-provoking articles. Stay tuned!
